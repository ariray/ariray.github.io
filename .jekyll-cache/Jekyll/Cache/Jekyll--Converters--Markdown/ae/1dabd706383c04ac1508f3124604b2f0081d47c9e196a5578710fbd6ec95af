I"2<p>My research is rooted in political economy and political behavior, and has focused mainly on Southern Europe. It is structured around two main pillars: <br /> (i) the factors that steer the economic policy preferences of political actors, such as voters and interest groups, and
<br /> (ii) the conditions under which the preferences of these actors are ultimately translated into policy.
<br /> Both lie at the core of questions surrounding democratic representation—for only when armed with a clear understanding of the interests of political actors, can we effectively start to discuss representation in substantive terms.</p>
