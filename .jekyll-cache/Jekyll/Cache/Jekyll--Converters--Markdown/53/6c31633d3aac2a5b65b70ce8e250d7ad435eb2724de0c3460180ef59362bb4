I""<p>My research is rooted in political economy and has focused mainly on Southern Europe. I draw on quantitative methods in attempts to improve our understanding of economic policymaking. My work is structured around two main pillars: (i) the factors that steer the economic policy preferences of political actors, such as voters and interest groups, and (ii) the conditions under which the preferences of these actors are ultimately translated into policy. Both, I find, lie at the core of questions surrounding democratic representationâ€”for only when we have a clear understanding of the political positions of participants in democratic processes, can we effectively start to discuss representation in substantive terms.</p>
