I"ë<p>PostDoc, University of Geneva](https://unequaldemocracies.unige.ch/en/people/ari-ray/)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a PostDoc and Senior Lecturer (ChargÃ©e de cours) at the <a href="https://unequaldemocracies.unige.ch/en/people/ari-ray/">University of Geneva</a>, where I work on the causes of socio-political inequality and the behavioral foundations of economic policymaking.</p>

<p>In my postdoctoral research, I leverage a combination of survey and public archival data to investigate the conditions under which people from structurally disprivileged backgrounds are able to attain public office. And I examine the extent to which their inclusion in democratic bodies results in the adoption of socially progressive economic policies.</p>

<p>Before arriving in Geneva, I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute; a PhD Researcher at the University of Zurich and a SNSF Predoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Projects of mine have recieved financing from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.</p>

<p>In Geneva, I teach the MA module on Comparative Politics, which is compulsory for students enrolled in Political Science and/or Public Policy programs.</p>
