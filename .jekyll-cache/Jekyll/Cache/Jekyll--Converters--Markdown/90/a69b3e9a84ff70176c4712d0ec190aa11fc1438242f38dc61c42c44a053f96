            <p>Are there trade-offs in the representation of women and workers? I analyze Italian
    archival data to examine how an exogenous increase in the number of women in elected
office affects legislature class composition. For this, I leverage an natural experiment,
in which some municipalities temporarily introduced gender quotas on party lists in
the mid-1990s. Findings show that having a singular election with a gender quota has
long-run positive effects on the descriptive representation of women who belong to the
lower-middle and working classes. The political opportunities of upper-middle class
women are unaffected by the quota, as are those of working class men. Instead, it is
upper- and lower-middle class men who lose out as a result of quota adoption. Results
highlight thatâ€”in contexts characterized by low levels of party gate-keepingâ€”gender
parity rules can work to bolster the prevalence of social groups that are the most under-
represented in politics. And that when this occurs, these improvements come mainly at
the cost of groups that are traditionally over-represented.</p>

            <p>What happens to peoplesâ€™ social policy preferences when their expectations
    concerning collective behavior are met, or even exceeded? And what conversely
  occurs when these expectations are unmet, and trust is thereby breached?
  Drawing on the first Italian COVID-19 lockdown as a massive exercise in col-
  lective action, this study tests how information on lockdown compliance rates
  causally affects the social policy preferences of Italian voters, conditional on
  their pre-treatment levels of trust. Examining social policy preferences across
  multiple dimensions, we find that trust is most closely linked to attitudes to-
  wards transfer generosity, as opposed to preferences on policy universalism and
  conditionality. Results highlight that neutral, fact-based information on co-
  operation levels can affect social policy preferencesâ€”and that the direction of
  attitude change depends on whether oneâ€™s trust has been met or breached.</p>

            <p>European countries during the Great Recession had to deal with massive economic shocks, leading to a surge in employment insecurity. How was this increase in employment risk distributed across societal groups? The prominent dualization hypothesis typically posits that outsiders, characterized by low labor market attachment, grow particularly vulnerable to a deterioration of employment prospects during recessions, while insiders remain comparatively sheltered from economic fluctuations. Using panel and cross-sectional data from France, Italy, Portugal and Spain for the pre-crisis, crisis and immediate postcrisis period, we show that this did not hold in Southern Europe during the Great Recession. Instead, employment prospects deteriorated more rapidly for insiders than for outsiders leading to convergence in the labor market conditions of the two groups. We suggest potential explanations for this finding and highlight a future research agenda for dualization scholars.</p>

            <p>Why was the Eurozone crisis so difficult to resolve? Why was it resolved in a manner in which some countries bore a much larger share of the pain than other countries? Why did no country leave the Eurozone rather than implement unprecedented austerity? Who supported and opposed the different policy options in the crisis domestically, and how did the distributive struggles among these groups shape crisis politics? Building on macro-level statistical data, original survey data from interest groups, and qualitative comparative case studies, this book argues and shows that the answers to these questions revolve around distributive struggles about how the costs of the Eurozone crisis should be divided among countries, and within countries, among different socioeconomic groups. Together with divergent but strongly held ideas about the â€™right wayâ€™ to conduct economic policy and asymmetries in the distribution of power among actors, severe distributive concerns of important actors lie at the root of the difficulties of resolving the Eurozone crisis as well as the difficulties to substantially reform EMU. The book provides new insights into the politics of the Eurozone crisis by emphasizing three perspectives that have received scant attention in existing research: a comparative perspective on the Eurozone crisis by systematically comparing it to previous financial crises, an analysis of the whole range of policy options, including the ones not chosen, and a unified framework that examines crisis politics not just in deficit-debtor, but also in surplus-creditor countries. </p>
