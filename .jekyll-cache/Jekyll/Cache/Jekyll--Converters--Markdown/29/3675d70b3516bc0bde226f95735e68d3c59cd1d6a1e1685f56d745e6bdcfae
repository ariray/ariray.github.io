I"Z<p>My research is rooted in political economy and political behavior, and has focused mainly on Southern Europe. It is structured around two main pillars:</p>

<p>(i) the institutional causes of political inequality</p>

<p>(ii) the material drivers of fiscal and spending preferences</p>

<p>Both lie at the core of questions surrounding democratic representationâ€”for only when armed with a clear understanding of the interests of political actors, can we effectively start to discuss representation in substantive terms.</p>
