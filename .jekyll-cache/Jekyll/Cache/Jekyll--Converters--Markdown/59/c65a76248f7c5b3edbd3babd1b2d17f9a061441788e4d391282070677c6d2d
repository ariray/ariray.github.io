I"°<p>Iâ€™m a PostDoc and Senior Lecturer (ChargÃ©e de cours) at the University of Geneva(https://unequaldemocracies.unige.ch/en/people/ari-ray/). My work centers on socio-political inequality and the behavioral foundations of economic policymaking.</p>

<p>Before arriving in Geneva, I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute; a PhD Researcher at the University of Zurich and a SNSF Predoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Projects of mine have recieved financing from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.</p>

<p>In Geneva, I teach the MA module on Comparative Politics, which is compulsory for students enrolled in Political Science and/or Public Policy programs.</p>
