I"b<h5 id="political-scientist-university-of-geneva">Political Scientist, <a href="https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/en/departments/dspri/">University of Geneva</a></h5>

<p>I’m a PostDoc at the <a href="https://unequaldemocracies.unige.ch/en/people/ari-ray/">University of Geneva</a>, and an incoming Junior Fellow at <a href="https://collegium.ethz.ch/">Collegium Helveticum</a>; the Zurich Institute of Advanced Studies.</p>

<p>I work on the causes of socio-political inequality and the behavioral foundations of economic policymaking. In my postdoctoral research, I leverage a combination of survey and public archival data to investigate the conditions under which people from structurally disprivileged backgrounds are able to attain public office.</p>

<p>Before arriving in Geneva, I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute; a PhD Researcher at the University of Zurich and a SNSF Predoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Projects of mine have recieved financing from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.</p>

<p>In Geneva, I teach the MA module on Comparative Politics. The course is compulsory for students enrolled in Political Science and/or Public Policy programs—and available as an elective for students from other social scientific displines.</p>
