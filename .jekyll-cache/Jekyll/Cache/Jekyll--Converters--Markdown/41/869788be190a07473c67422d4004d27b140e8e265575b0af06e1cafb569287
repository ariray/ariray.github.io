  My research is rooted in political economy and political behavior, and has focused mainly on Southern Europe. It is structured around two main pillars:

   (i) the factors that steer the economic policy preferences of political actors, such as voters and interest groups, and

   (ii) the conditions under which the preferences of these actors are ultimately translated into policy.

   Both lie at the core of questions surrounding democratic representation---for only when armed with a clear understanding of the interests of political actors, can we effectively start to discuss representation in substantive terms.</div>
