I'm a PostDoc and Senior Lecturer (Chargée de cours) at the University of Geneva(https://unequaldemocracies.unige.ch/en/people/ari-ray/). My work centers on socio-political inequality and the behavioral foundations of economic policymaking.

Before arriving in Geneva, I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute; a PhD Researcher at the University of Zurich and a SNSF Predoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Projects of mine have recieved financing from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.

In Geneva, I teach the MA module on Comparative Politics, which is compulsory for students enrolled in Political Science and/or Public Policy programs.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
