##### Political Scientist, [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/en/departments/dspri/)

I'm a PostDoc and Senior Lecturer (Chargée de cours) at the [University of Geneva](https://unequaldemocracies.unige.ch/en/people/ari-ray/), where I work on the causes of socio-political inequality and the behavioral foundations of economic policymaking.

In my postdoctoral research, I leverage a combination of survey and public archival data to investigate the conditions under which people from structurally disprivileged backgrounds are able to attain public office. And I examine the extent to which their inclusion in democratic bodies results in the adoption of socially progressive economic policies.

Before arriving in Geneva, I was a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute; a PhD Researcher at the University of Zurich and a SNSF Predoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Projects of mine have recieved financing from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.

In Geneva, I teach the MA module on Comparative Politics. The course is compulsory for students enrolled in Political Science and/or Public Policy programs; available as an elective for students from other social scientific displines.
