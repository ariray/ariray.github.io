    abstract={Are there trade-offs in the representation of women and workers? I analyze Italian
    archival data to examine how an exogenous increase in the number of women in elected
    office affects legislature class composition. For this, I leverage an natural experiment,
    in which some municipalities temporarily introduced gender quotas on party lists in
    the mid-1990s. Findings show that having a singular election with a gender quota has
    positive effects on the descriptive representation of women who belong to the lowermiddle
    and working classes. The political opportunities of upper-middle class women
    were unaffected by the quota, as are those of working class men. Instead, it is middle
    class men who lose out as a result of quota adoption. Results highlight that—in contexts
    characterized by low levels of party gate-keeping—gender parity rules can work to
    bolster the prevalence of social groups that are the most under-represented in politics.
    And that when this occurs, these improvements come mainly at the cost of groups that
    are traditionally over-represented.},

    title={Trust in Action: Cooperation, Information and Social Policy Preferences},
    author={Colombo, Francesco and Ray, Ari},
    year={2021},
    journal={Unequal Democracies Working Papers},
    publisher={University of Geneva},
    number={No. 25},
    abstract={What happens to peoples’ social policy preferences when their expectations
    concerning collective behavior are met, or even exceeded? And what conversely
  occurs when these expectations are unmet, and trust is thereby breached?
  Drawing on the first Italian COVID-19 lockdown as a massive exercise in col-
  lective action, this study tests how information on lockdown compliance rates
  causally affects the social policy preferences of Italian voters, conditional on
  their pre-treatment levels of trust. Examining social policy preferences across
  multiple dimensions, we find that trust is most closely linked to attitudes to-
  wards transfer generosity, as opposed to preferences on policy universalism and
  conditionality. Results highlight that neutral, fact-based information on co-
  operation levels can affect social policy preferences—and that the direction of
  attitude change depends on whether one’s trust has been met or breached.},

  title={Altered risks or static divides? Labor market inequality during the Great Recession},
  author={Ray, Ari and Schwander, Hanna},
  year={2020},
  number={2020/09},
  abstract={European countries during the Great Recession had to deal with massive economic shocks, leading to a surge in employment insecurity. How was this increase in employment risk distributed across societal groups? The prominent dualization hypothesis typically posits that outsiders, characterized by low labor market attachment, grow particularly vulnerable to a deterioration of employment prospects during recessions, while insiders remain comparatively sheltered from economic fluctuations. Using panel and cross-sectional data from France, Italy, Portugal and Spain for the pre-crisis, crisis and immediate postcrisis period, we show that this did not hold in Southern Europe during the Great Recession. Instead, employment prospects deteriorated more rapidly for insiders than for outsiders leading to convergence in the labor market conditions of the two groups. We suggest potential explanations for this finding and highlight a future research agenda for dualization scholars.},

  title={The Politics of Bad Options: Why the Eurozone's Problems Have Been So Hard to Resolve},
  author={with Walter, Stefanie and Ray, Ari and Redeker, Nils},
  year={2020},
  publisher={Oxford University Press},
  code = {https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/13023/16750/overview},
  html={https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-politics-of-bad-options-9780198857020?cc=us&lang=en&},
  abstract={Why was the Eurozone crisis so difficult to resolve? Why was it resolved in a manner in which some countries bore a much larger share of the pain than other countries? Why did no country leave the Eurozone rather than implement unprecedented austerity? Who supported and opposed the different policy options in the crisis domestically, and how did the distributive struggles among these groups shape crisis politics? Building on macro-level statistical data, original survey data from interest groups, and qualitative comparative case studies, this book argues and shows that the answers to these questions revolve around distributive struggles about how the costs of the Eurozone crisis should be divided among countries, and within countries, among different socioeconomic groups. Together with divergent but strongly held ideas about the 'right way' to conduct economic policy and asymmetries in the distribution of power among actors, severe distributive concerns of important actors lie at the root of the difficulties of resolving the Eurozone crisis as well as the difficulties to substantially reform EMU. The book provides new insights into the politics of the Eurozone crisis by emphasizing three perspectives that have received scant attention in existing research: a comparative perspective on the Eurozone crisis by systematically comparing it to previous financial crises, an analysis of the whole range of policy options, including the ones not chosen, and a unified framework that examines crisis politics not just in deficit-debtor, but also in surplus-creditor countries. },
